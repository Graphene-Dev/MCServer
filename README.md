#### About this Project
We are planning to do a Minecraft Server written in Kotlin
### Startup Server:
0. If you haven't Java 16 installed you should do it now or the server won't start
1. Download newest jar from this repo
2. Run it with `java -jar [JARFILE]`
3. Accept the EULA, you can now also configure the server in properties.json
4. Repeat step 2
5. Connect to Server

### Known Issues:
- Client won't show the ping to the server (reason unknown)
